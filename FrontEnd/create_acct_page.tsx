Filename: create_acct_page.tsx  

Purpose:  
This program renders the SignUp component, which allows a user to create a new account.  

System Context:  
This file is part of the FrontEnd system. It contributes to the overall functionality by serving as the route-level page that displays the account creation form to the user.

Existence Rationale:  
This file exists as a wrapper to render the account creation form component (create_acct.tsx) in the correct location of the application.  

Data Structures and Algorithms:  
No complex data structures or algorithms are used. This file simply imports and renders a React component.  

Expected Input:  
N/A â€” this page does not take any input directly.  

Possible Output:  
A rendered SignUp form that allows the user to enter their account details.  

Future Extensions or Revisions:

- Include additional messaging or onboarding flow before or after account creation.
